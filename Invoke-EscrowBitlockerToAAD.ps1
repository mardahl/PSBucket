.SYNOPSIS
    Escrow (Backup) the existing Bitlocker key protectors to Azure AD (Intune)

.DESCRIPTION
    This script will verify the presence of existing recovery keys and have them escrowed (backed up) to Azure AD
    Great for switching away from MBAM on-prem to using Intune and Azure AD for Bitlocker key management

.INPUTS
    None

.EXAMPLE
    Execute script as system or administrator
    .\Invoke-EscrowBitlockerToAAD.ps1

.NOTES
    If there is a policy mismatch, then you might get errors from the built-in cmdlet BackupToAAD-BitLockerKeyProtector.
    So I have wrapped the cmdlet in a try/catch in order to supress the error. This means that you will have to manually verify that the key was actually escrowed.
    Check MSEndpointMgr.com for solutions to get reporting stats on this.
